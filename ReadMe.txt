Camera calibration for DVS cameras
http://www.garrickorchard.com/code

This code relies heavily on the Caltech Camera Calibration Toolbox, available from 
www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/
Since the toolbox was not created by us, we refer users to the original site above for download. However, should the toolbox no longer be available, contact Garrick Orchard for a copy.


Here we simply provide means to: 

1: Generate an accurate calibration pattern on the screen

2: Flash the calibration pattern (for DVS sensors)

3: convert the recorded events into images which can be used by the caltech toolbox


The script 'example.m' shows how to use the functions.
